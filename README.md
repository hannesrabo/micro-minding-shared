# About: micro-minding-shared

This is a submodule to the larger project of building a real time application with microservices. The main goal of the application is to provide a collaborative mind-map in real time for multiple people. The main repo is available at [hannesrabo/micro-minding](https://github.com/hannesrabo/micro-minding).

This module provides scrips and files that are needed in multiple parts of the project. For now that only includes build scripts and proto buff files.
